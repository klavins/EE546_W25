Project Decisions
---

1) Please coordinate with your team. I would like teams be 2 or 3 people each. So the big linear algebra team needs to break up into 2 or 3 smaller teams with distinct, non-overlapping, but synergystic teams. 

2) Describe in a few sentences up to three different results in your area of interest that your group would like to encode in Lean. For each area, give reference to a text book and the specific page number where the result is stated. Books we can find a pdf of online would be nice so people can easily see what everyone is doing.

3) For each idea, discuss ways to break the work up among your team. 

4) Turn in your work in the usual way, but also be prepared to discuss on Tuesday 2/6.
