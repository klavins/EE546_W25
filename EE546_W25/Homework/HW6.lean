Prepare a project update for Thursday Feb 20.

If you are stuck with on complicated theorem and do not know where to go next, consider going back to simpler problems. For example,

  - If you are working with matrices, can you limit your results to 2x2 matrices?
  - If you are working with integrals, can you figure out how they are defined in Lean and show some examples? Can you do some basic manipulations with sums instead of integrals?
  - If you are trying to show an algorithm terminates, can you show that a simpler one terminates? Can you find examples of terminating algorithms by searching for "termination_by" and "decreasing_by" in the mathlib source code?

Please plan to present everything in VSCode, with explanations in comments, the screen properly magnified, and without displaying any extraneously sub-windows.
