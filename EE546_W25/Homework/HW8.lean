1) Now that you have been working on your project for a few weeks, and understand better what Lean and Mathlab can do, it is time to crisply define your goal. Write a one paragraph description of where you expect your project to be by the end of the quarter. Note you will be presenting the projects on Thursday March 13 in class and the final write up is due by the end of finals week (March 21).

2) The final project shoould be turned in as a standalone Lean project and put in Github. You make make it public or private, whichever you prefer. The README should be a standalone, well written document descriing your results. Additionally,

  - The README should contain Markdown, LaTeX and Lean code.
  - The Lean code in the README should be syntax-highlighted so it is easier to read.
  - All external material (books, papers, websites) used should be listed.
  - Library code should be described at a high level in the README, and well-documented in the source code.

An example project can be found [here](https://github.com/klavins/ModGroup).

3) Other than the above, continue working on your projects!
